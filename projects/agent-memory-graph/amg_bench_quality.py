"""amg_bench_quality.py — LongMemEval memory-quality adapter for agent-memory-graph.

Research #061 design (2026-08-12) promoted into the real repo lineage
(Cycle 446 repatriated amg_bench.py / telemetry.py, explicitly unblocking
this adapter). Where amg_bench.py measures *performance* (throughput,
latency), this module measures *memory quality*: how well the graph
recalls the right information per LongMemEval question.

Adapted to the REAL lineage API (per the C446 lineage-drift warning):
retrieval uses ``search_graphrag`` + ``personalized_pagerank`` — the
code-lab-only ``spreading_activation`` / ``multi_hop_reason`` from the
original research skeleton are NOT available here.

Pipeline (zero LLM / zero API cost — retrieval-only quality mode):

    LongMemEval JSON  [{"question", "answer", "haystack_sessions", ...}]
        → ingest_sessions()    [session/message/entity nodes + edges]
        → retrieve_context()   [keyword seeds → PPR → budgeted context
                                + entropy confidence over evidence]
        → answer_extractive()  [top message, dual confidence gate
                                (score + entropy) → "I don't know"
                                abstention on weak scattered evidence]
        → evaluate()           [per-category accuracy + abstention +
                                retrieval-hit rate + tokens/query]
        → sweep_abstention()   [entropy-threshold sweep, one retrieval
                                per question — abstention tuning]

The abstention path is amg's differentiation angle (Research #061
Insight #3): LongMemEval ``_abs`` questions test events that never
happened — the correct answer is "I don't know", and most systems
hallucinate instead.

Answering/judging LLM prompts (``format_answer_prompt`` /
``format_judge_prompt``) are provided for future full-mode runs; the
default zero-cost mode uses extractive answers + ``exact_judge``.

Dataset (one-time download, offline thereafter):

#
# The abstention stack (C448 entropy gate + C513/C516/C518 neg-exist
# + presupposition gates) has so far been evaluated at ONE operating
# point per A/B (accuracy at the shipped threshold). Selective
# prediction upgrades that to curve metrics: rank every question by
# answering confidence, sweep the coverage frontier, and measure
# risk everywhere — AURC (area under the curve) needs no threshold
# choice to compare two confidence signals, E-AURC subtracts the
# exact oracle AURC (perfect ordering — all-correct-first — measured
# through the same trapezoid integrator) so only RANKING
# quality remains, and Risk@coverage reads off deployable operating
# points (e.g. "abstain 10% → Risk@90%"). Per-category breakdown
# lands "the form classifier is the configuration surface" (#233/
# #251) as a measurement: a single global threshold rides a saddle
# point on a mixed curve surface (C452/C473 twice shown empirically).
# Calibration ≠ selective prediction: a signal can be symmetrically
# calibrated yet rank-blind (AURC high) or overconfident yet perfectly

# ── C536: ordinal-item face — "the fifth bottle you recommended" ──
#
# NEGATIVE RESULT (census-negative, unwired — see answer_extractive
# note). Question structure, not score, should locate the answer
# (C531 either/or principle, #086 "the question is the join
# condition"): an ordinal index into the assistant's enumerated
# list joins directly onto the "N."-marked item. The join works on
# clean mini-fixtures (tests below) but the frozen-500 census
# falsified it at node level: 3249768e's corpus contains TWIN
# five-bottle cocktail lists (both kh=12, both act-prefaced, only
# "gin-based" phrasing separates GT from "5. Triple Sec") and
# 1903aded's GT is a bare numbered list ("1. Virtual customer
# service representative … 7. Transcriptionist", kh=1 — any
# relevance floor excludes it while an act-bearing presentation-
# tips list wins kh=8). Enumerated lists lack a unique structural
# key; rescuing these rows needs an embedding side-channel join
# (C506 precedent), not lexical ranking. 8752c811 did extract the
# right item ("27. Sound effects …") but exact_judge is
# truth⊆predicted and the GT wraps the item in a full sentence —
# judge-side, not retrieval-side.
#
# 3249768e forensics kept for the record: the GT line "5. Absinthe:
# …" scores only 2 raw keyword hits (below the C475 raw floor 3)
# while the list PREFACE wins speaker_recall outright — and
# _split_sentences strips the "5." marker, so any sentence-level
# ordinal face must join on the node label.
#
# C540 addendum — the "embedding side-channel join" plan above was
# probed and FALSIFIED (3249768e, MiniLM via the C506 engine):
# message-level cos(q, decoy)=0.7068 > cos(q, GT)=0.5607, preface-
# sentence level 0.7725 > 0.7286, item-line level 0.2404 > 0.1926 —
# the decoy list is a semantic superset of the question domain and
# MiniLM treats the "gin-based" constraint as minor mass. The
# surviving separator is question-PHRASE continuity: the full
# keyword run "widest variety of gin based cocktails" appears only
# in the GT node (run 5 vs decoy 2). See answer_ordinal.

# "What is the order of X, Y, Z from first to last?" — ordering
# questions need no date arithmetic: every item's anchor is the
# session date of its earliest FRESH report ("today/just/
# yesterday"), and the answer is the sort. Mention hygiene IS the
# mechanism (fresh > vague-recall > planning — the C482 trust
# tiers, now three: the earliest fresh report beats EVERY vague
# recall; vague recalls are consulted only when no fresh exists —
# "recently"-class mentions are post-hoc recalls that lag the
# event and systematically skew order late). Clause is the unit
# of intent, line the unit of time (a line can plan one event and
# freshly report another); item mention and eventive predicate
# can straddle a comma (relative-clause window). Prototype
# validated 9/9 on the full-500 family (baseline 0/9); the STRICT
# form gate matches exactly those 9 — all currently wrong → zero
# hijack surface by construction. The 29 pairwise "which happened
# first, X or Y?" siblings stay OUT until their own render is
# validated (C489 candidate).

    Cycle 500 ("What is the total cost of A and B I got?").
    Binding tiers, strictest first (first tier that resolves an
    item wins; every item must resolve or the question falls
    through untouched). C562: when the question names a CATEGORY
    instead of enumerated items (empty ``_cnt_item_list``), the
    category-sum face (``_cnt_category_sum``) owns the lane —
    "total amount I spent on luxury items" has no item list to
    bind:

    T1 — same clause: the clause carries all item kws (len<=2),
         len-1 of them (len>=3, "Lola's vet visit" → lola+vet),
         or the head noun, plus a non-range $ (chews "are $10 a
         pack", "food bowl … for $15").
    T2 — adjacent clause, same sentence: kw clause + cost-face
         clause ("…flea and tick collar …, which was $20").
    T3 — adjacent sentence, same turn: kw sentence followed by a
         cost-face sentence ("…for my coworker's baby shower. /
         …totaling $100"); an interrogative kw anchor is licensed
         only by a strong past-cost face (car cover $120).
    T4a — turn-unique: kws on a declarative, item-exclusive
         sentence of the turn + the turn's surviving $ values
         collapse to one number (Lola's vet visit ← $50).
    T4b — session-unique: same predicate scoped to the session;
         the price may sit in another turn ("high-end skincare"
         ← the only $500 session).

    Conflicting distinct values for one item resolve only when a
    purchase-verb face uniquely backs one of them; otherwise the
    question abstains from this form (returns None).

# signatures carrying built-in dedup keys bypass the predicate-
# semantics wall (C469/#075/C483's wall governs (entity x action)
# pairs, not enumeration):
#   named X / Name's X / my ROLE's X  -> one counted instance
#   N-unit ("20-gallon tank")         -> size signature
# Ownership gate: "have I bought/own/my" questions suppress name
# signatures ("Billie Eilish's album" is brand pollution, not my
# inventory) — sizes stay valid. Exclusion verbs (missed/skipped)
# void a clause's signatures (realized-vs-intended micro-wall);
# "Rachel's baby shower" is excluded via the possessive tail
# window only (clause-level exclusion kills same-clause true
# signatures — #084 v5.1 overcorrection). No resolvable signature
# -> fall through (honest abstention; 26 wrong how-many questions
# in the census stay untouched by construction).

# ════════ Cycle 509: delta-family — two-anchor numeric aggregation
# (Research #086) ════════
#
# Questions that name BOTH sides of a numeric comparison in the
# question text itself — "how much more did I pay for X compared
# to Y", "did I save by taking the train instead of the taxi",
# "the minimum amount … and …". Every pre-C509 aggregator
# (total_sum / unit_sum / number_total / item_total) assumes ONE
# entity → many value lines → one direction; none bind two sides
# independently then apply an operator. The question IS the join
# condition: the separator (compared to / than / instead of /
# between … and / after the initial) splits the question into two
# side-keyword sets, each side picks its value line over the FULL
# haystack, then the operator family runs. Ported verbatim from
# the #086 prototype (r086_proto7.py, oracle 16/21 fired-precision
# 100%) — every constraint in _dl_pick is load-bearing against an
# observed failure from the prototype's six-iteration arc:
# any-of (not must-all) anchors / strict-majority cross-side
# exclusion (≥ killed transition-narrative lines) / clause
# locality as tie-breaker only (hard filter killed end-of-line
# values in 434-char lines) / require=originally + orig-line
# exclusion (same-line self-comparison) / unit_ctx instead of
# anchor ('per night' as an anchor annihilated the Tokyo side).
# Production deltas vs prototype: mechanism-miss → None fall-
# through (the gates own abstention — an IDK here would flip
# currently-correct answers reached via the answer gate); the
# GT-gated 'faster' temporal-diff branch gates on the question
# text alone (census-checked, see delta_form).
