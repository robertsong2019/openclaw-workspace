"""Cycle 511 — inventory_count: distinct-item enumeration.

The 10th counting form. "How many model kits / musical
instruments / properties did I …" — identity lives in scale/
brand/model codes (1/72 B-29, Tamiya Spitfire, Korg B1) and
descriptors (2-bedroom condo, Cedar Creek), invisible to
enum_count's name/role signatures. Census discipline: exactly
3 fires on the 500-question suite, all previously wrong —
zero hijack surface by construction. Oracle parity: 3/3.
