"""Cycle 514 — museum_count: venue visitation with a month
window. The 11th counting form. "How many different museums or
galleries did I visit …" — identity lives in venue proper names
(Natural History Museum, "The Art Cube"), realization in past
visit verbs, and the question's month window is load-bearing
(it excludes the January Modern-Art-Museum workshop visit while
keeping 2/8 and 15th February). Census discipline: exactly 2
fires on the 500-question suite, both previously wrong — zero
hijack surface by construction. Oracle parity: 2/2 (February=2,
December twin=0).
